A simple Grails app that demonstrates mapping Java domain
classes as GORM domain classes.

In particular, notice these files...

src/java/com/demo/Person.java
grails-app/conf/hibernate/hibernate.cfg.xml
grails-app/conf/DataSource.groovy
lib/car.jar

Person.java represents an annotated entity as well as
the com.demo.Car class which is in lib/car.jar.
